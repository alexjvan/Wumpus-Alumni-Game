# Wumpus Alumni Game
This code was writen in Unity 5.6.3. This is the optimal way to view & edit the code, as it may not work with other versions of Unity.

This code was not solely written by me. This code was written by me (Alex Van Matre) alongside of 4 other people (Tyler Detert, Devon Gronquist, Orrin Harbol, and Ashley Hopper)[ordered by last name]. I do not take full credit for the code, but will take credit for the parts that I had worked on.
